During \u201cLanding Week\u201d, it set the tone for what\u2019s to come, blending a unique mix of familiarization and intensive learning. Right off the bat, my classmates stood out \u2013 a diverse group of enthusiastic individuals from varied backgrounds, each bringing a unique perspective to the table. Our educators wasted no time diving deep. Philosophy sessions stirred introspection and first-person research emphasized the essence of experiential narrative in design. The technical side wasn\u2019t neglected; grappling with Git sessions and mastering the art of documenting design marked the week. One week in, and it\u2019s evident \u2013 this journey will challenge conventions and redefine our horizons.

You can check my excercise in Miro here: \u00b6 Atlas of Weak Signals Deck \u00b6 Atlas of weak signals deck. Class excercise \u00b6 For this excercise, my team and I drew Carbon Neutral Lifestyle & Refugee Tech . With the random triggers Microbiotic Literacy & Neighborhood FabLabs . And the Areas of opportunity being Supply Chain Innovation & Circular Economy . As you can see on the picture, the conversation was very interesting, touching on topics of access, results, and changes in the way people consume things. Here\u2019s where my idea for the Hierarchy of needs that I added later came from. Full Deck Spread and my additions \u00b6 Here you can see how the full deck looks when open, I\u2019ve added a couple of cards to each category: Designing for the Anthropocene Raising the population\u2019s hierarchy of needs. For this card, the thinking behind it is that using Abraham Maslow\u2019s famous hierarchy of basic needs, we have an (imperfect) way to see how society might evolve towards a preferable future if the population\u2019s basic needs are met in a higher percentage than they are today. Random Triggers Star Trek: Thinking about a future post scarcity society as a trigger for people to ideate with a different mindset than a more collapse-based scenario. Latin America: Thinking about a specific part of the world might also lead to interesting results when analyzing possible scenarios. Areas of opportunity User Experience: Having the user experience as the main point for areas of opportunity might work as a great lens to scenarios things through. Challenge System: To think about a system as a way of executing the path for preferable scenarios. Experience: Again, Experience as the challenge. Initial Design Space \u00b6 Human Machine Creative Collaboration + Climate Conscience Reddit + Back to the future + Psilocybin Ideation and Design Centric Reseach + Multi-Scalar Thinking + Design for Social Innovation Building a Design Space \u00b6 Here I went a bit crazy with references for each of the main subjects, including links to scientific papers to actually get some signals. I\u2019m pretty satisfied with the available information for this. Multi-scalar Design Space \u00b6 Here I placed my references in the Multi-scalar framework, being careful to also think about the impact that these ideas might have in possible resulting scenarios. Mixed Atlas of Weak Signals \u00b6 Using both main signals, I concluded several possible avenues for research and continued ideation in hopes of creating positive scenarios for Human-machine creative collaboration FOR Climate Conscience. Personalized Design Space \u00b6 This is how my design space looks with the possible avenues for these subjects. I believe the interconnectedness of the subjects we are talking about might produce some very interesting results for projects during this master\u2019s.

Prototyping excercise \u00b6 For one of our first exercises, we shared past projects with our group, and exchanged them to re-think them with a new perspective. My fellow student Ever, talked about a project in his architecture degree, where they proposed the famously exclusive University to open a new passageway through a wall that leads to a barrio that usually houses foreign students, and they prefer walking since they are very close. Problem is, this university is extremely car-centric in it\u2019s approach to entrances and exits, and since these entrances are only for people associated with the university, anyone wanting walk through it cannot, and instead has to walk around the university. So in my re-imagined design project, the new gate has a very chaotic, and frankly dystopic solution for non-university related people to be able to go through: to be enveloped in a human sized plastic bubble, so they can walk across campus, and only be able to leave the bubble, once they cross to the other side. To be fair (....) this is obviously a very exaggerated solution, but I find it would really emphasize the university\u2019s policies of only letting alumni and related people inside, unlike universities in Europe, for example. Reflection \u00b6 I think this was a very interesting excercise since we were allowed to create more \u2018Critical Design\u2019 type solutions to other people\u2019s projects, which is why I allowed myself to create such aggressive and frankly crazy solution for Everardo\u2019s University project.","title":"Design Studio"},{"location":"term1/04-Design%20Studio/#design-studio","text":"As for design studio, we\u2019re diving deep into prototyping, it\u2019s roles, and first person research.","title":"Design Studio"},{"location":"term1/04-Design%20Studio/#prototyping-excercise","text":"For one of our first exercises, we shared past projects with our group, and exchanged them to re-think them with a new perspective.

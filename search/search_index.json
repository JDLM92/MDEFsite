Prototyping excercise \u00b6 For one of our first exercises, we shared past projects with our group, and exchanged them to re-think them with a new perspective. My fellow student Ever, talked about a project in his architecture degree, where they proposed the famously exclusive University to open a new passageway through a wall that leads to a barrio that usually houses foreign students, and they prefer walking since they are very close. Problem is, this university is extremely car-centric in it\u2019s approach to entrances and exits, and since these entrances are only for people associated with the university, anyone wanting walk through it cannot, and instead has to walk around the university. So in my re-imagined design project, the new gate has a very chaotic, and frankly dystopic solution for non-university related people to be able to go through: to be enveloped in a human sized plastic bubble, so they can walk across campus, and only be able to leave the bubble, once they cross to the other side. To be fair (....) this is obviously a very exaggerated solution, but I find it would really emphasize the university\u2019s policies of only letting alumni and related people inside, unlike universities in Europe, for example. Reflection \u00b6 I think this was a very interesting excercise since we were allowed to create more \u2018Critical Design\u2019 type solutions to other people\u2019s projects, which is why I allowed myself to create such aggressive and frankly crazy solution for Everardo\u2019s University project. Personal RtD Toolbox \u00b6 I\u2019ve downloaded some of my Skills, Tools, People, and places to this RtD Toolbox, but I figured I\u2019ll keep updating it as the course keeps going, since I feel like I\u2019m learning so much, including how to finally connect some diverging learning streaks I\u2019ve made in various subjects into a more tangible project. Shared Design Space and Design Intervention \u00b6 This project has been very intense since it\u2019s been running in parallel to other projects. Our initial ambitions were demolished as time passed, but we ended up learning some really valuable information that with maybe a bit more time we will be able to understand and help shape our future strategy regarding waste disposal systems. Initially our ideas revolved around getting interesting data from waste disposal companies, maybe even data that they were not collecting themselves, our idea revolving around identifying where in the city waste was being separated properly with the goal of reducing strain in the \u201ccircularity\u201d of Barcelona. After our visit at Urbaser, where we were given a great chat about the current effort that they are making, and some interesting insights into the current system of waste disposal of the city, we were also given the privilege of visiting the green roof of their building, which was an amazing experience, and expecially coming from the man himself, Joan Bosch, who was granted 100k euro from the government to fund the exploration of this very interesting idea for wellbeing and temperature management. In the end, we learned that much of what we thought would be possible, was either already being tested, or simply unfeasable for our timeframe, so we decided to refocus our intervention between two ways of affecting the current system: 1. To better understand and 2. To better educate Since our intention is to make a ding in the current way of doing things we have to acknowledge the variables that make it what it is, in this case, we learned that 59% of the waste disposed is thrown in the \u2018resta\u2019 bin, meaning more than half the waste thrown away was not separated properly. We decided to intervene this system, by learning of what is being done already, and the behavioral nudge that is being implemented falls on the premise that anonymity means people will not care to separate waste properly, but in my personal opinion, having to look over every person disposing of waste is maybe not the best long term solution, so we decided education and public participation was the goal, meaning we would have to find a way to Educate our fellow citizens so they understand why they must try to separate their waste better, instead of imposing more rules to do it. Our final solution is to have an always evolving set of informational outlets to keep the public updated on the best way to reduce their impact in the circularity of the city, this set consists of an Instagram page called BinGo , where we explain which bin to use for different types of waste in four different languages, aswell as an infographic focused data outlet where we periodically inform the citizens of Barcelona of the current best way to be informed about the circular system.

Intervention: Community Builder \u00b6 The task \u00b6 During the course of the class, my teammates, Jorge, Sophie, and Myself had ideas around communities and the process to become organizations that can be more efficient in achieving their goals, even from the ground up. We began by identifying the common challenges faced by both new and established communities. For new communities, the challenges are often about establishing a clear structure and vision, while established communities might struggle with adapting to change, resolving conflicts, or maintaining active engagement. A key decision in the development of Community Builder was to base it on sociocracy principles. Sociocracy, known for its emphasis on equality in decision-making, was chosen for its democratic and inclusive approach, ensuring that every member of a community has a voice. Another crucial component of Community Builder is its one-question-at-a-time assessment process. This was designed to gather essential information about a community, such as member count, existing structures, and specific challenges, in a way that is not overwhelming and allows for thoughtful responses. The tool was designed to not only assess but also provide actionable guidance. This includes recommendations for organizational structures, action plans for implementing changes, feedback mechanisms, and conflict resolution strategies. Recognizing the importance of clarity, the tool was designed to visually represent community structures and feedback mechanisms in a way that could be easily understood and implemented. The ultimate goal of Community Builder is to empower communities to enact change. Whether it\u2019s a new community laying its foundation or an established one seeking revitalization, the tool is meant to guide them towards a more democratic, inclusive, and sustainable future. The solution: \u00b6 Welcome to Community Builder, the innovative solution designed to transform the way communities operate and interact. At its core, Community Builder is a specialized tool that integrates the principles of sociocracy to guide both new and existing communities in creating more democratic, inclusive, and efficient governance structures. Whether you\u2019re looking to establish a new community or enhance the dynamics of an existing one, Community Builder offers a unique blend of assessment, planning, and implementation strategies. With a focus on participatory decision-making and equitable involvement, Community Builder enables communities to thrive through improved communication, effective conflict resolution, and adaptive governance models. By tailoring its approach to each community\u2019s specific needs, Community Builder ensures that every member\u2019s voice is heard and valued, fostering a sense of belonging and shared purpose. This tool is more than just a platform; it\u2019s a pathway to building harmonious, resilient, and sustainable communities for the future.

From the get-go with Pau Artigas at the helm, we didn\u2019t just skim the surface of AI; we dove headfirst into its deep and murky waters. Day 2 was all about getting our heads around the tech side of things. We delved into neural networks, datasets, training, and models. It was like piecing together a complex jigsaw puzzle, with each part \u2013 neural networks with their self-configuration mojo, diverse datasets, the nitty-gritty of training, and the final model \u2013 coming together to form a complete picture. It\u2019s fascinating how these networks configure themselves based on examples, and how the type of data they work with (be it images, text, or sound) shapes their learning. Then, Day 3 had us exploring the enigmatic world of Latent Spaces. Imagine a realm where data points are not just data points, but multi-dimensional representations capturing the essence of the data. It\u2019s like stepping into a parallel universe where everything you thought you knew about data gets a whole new meaning. What really got me thinking was the exercise on datasets. It was an eye-opener, making us critically analyze and choose datasets that resonated with us for various reasons \u2013 be it their utility, curiosity, or the potential issues they presented. It pushed us to think beyond the usual and consider the impact of the data we feed into these AI systems. Throughout the course, we kept circling back to the foundational models, grounding our understanding in the solid bedrock of AI concepts. It\u2019s like having a trusty map while navigating the often-confusing terrain of AI technologies. In all of this, the ethical and social implications of AI were never far from our minds. It was like having a moral compass guiding us through our journey, ensuring we didn\u2019t lose sight of the bigger picture \u2013 the impact of AI on society and our responsibility towards it. As we wrapped up the course, it was clear that our understanding of AI had evolved. It wasn\u2019t just about the technology anymore; it was about seeing AI as a tool for change, a medium for creative expression, and a subject of critical analysis. It\u2019s like we\u2019ve been equipped with a new lens to view the world, one where AI plays a crucial, yet complex, role. All in all, the Extended Intelligences course has been an enlightening journey, melding technical skills with critical thinking and a deep understanding of the ethical dimensions of AI. It\u2019s not just a course; it\u2019s a whole new perspective on what AI is and what it could be. Intervention \u00b6 Jumping back into the mindset of the \u201cLiving with Your Own Ideas\u201d course through this project was like revisiting an old friend with new stories to share. The project amplified my belief that shaping individual behaviors hinges on fostering a sense of community and collective action. It was never about penalizing ourselves; instead, we aimed to reframe our daily habits in a positive light. Visualizing energy consumption as euros tucked away, considering each commute as a step towards a greener planet, and comparing our food waste to that of an average person, made the whole process less of a chore and more of a rewarding game. Bringing our little device to class added a new dimension to our project. It wasn\u2019t just a gadget; it was a conversation starter. As we unpacked its purpose - to monitor our daily energy consumption - our classmates\u2019 intrigue turned into a real-time reflection on our collective habits. This sparked discussions about sustainability in a way that was both engaging and eye-opening. This experience underlined a crucial learning for me: positive framing in environmental conservation can lead to more impactful and motivating discussions. Furthermore, embarking on this journey as a team not only heightened our collective responsibility but also highlighted the need for easier, more automated ways to track and maintain these eco-friendly habits in our busy lives. The video: Our AI Solution: \u00b6 First off, we had to figure out how to get the input image from the user and pinpoint the food waste in it. It was like teaching the system to see through our eyes and understand our intention. Then came the real brain teaser - taking those identified ingredients and scouring for the most fitting repurpose method. It was a deep dive into a sea of possibilities, each more intriguing than the last. The third step was where the magic happened. We aimed to create a generated image that visually represented the repurposing method. This wasn\u2019t just about coding; it was about infusing creativity into technology, making the AI not just a tool but an artist in its own right. The final step was about bringing it all together. We wanted to present the user with a tangible output \u2013 a printed card that displayed both the image and the suggested reuse method. It was like crafting a story from data, a narrative that spoke of potential and sustainability. As we embarked on the journey to bring this AI to life, the hunt for the right APIs was crucial.

This project is part of mine and my teammate Marius\u2019 aspiration to transcend traditional educational paradigms in all ages, introducing a multidimensional, immersive learning landscape tailored to the nuanced spectrum of, in this case, young learners\u2019 interests and inclinations. Here\u2019s a deeper dive into our process, philosophy, and the insights that emerged along this creative journey. Ideation and Conceptualization \u00b6 The genesis of this intervention was anchored in our collective curiosity about the untapped potential of immersive technologies in educational settings, and the connection that Pablo helped us make with Dalia Kager, a teacher in Croatia that is also experimenting with this sibject. Grounded by the need for a way to help kids learn the multiplication tables better, we aimed for thecreation of diverse, gender-neutral archetype personas, seeking to navigate the intricatcies of 3 rd graders\u2019 interests, from the vast cosmos of space exploration to the art of cooking and beyond. These personas served as the bedrock for our innovative quiz/bot mechanism, designed to shepherd students along personalized learning journeys. Collaborative Dynamics \u00b6 Central to our approach was the ideation of collaborative tasks, ideated to dissolve the barriers between disparate interests. Through these orchestrated interactions, we seeked to cultivate a classroom environment where diversity of thought and mutual respect flourished. This strategy was not merely about knowledge acquisition but about nurturing a community of learners equipped with empathy, teamwork, and an appreciation for interdisciplinary exploration. Pedagogical Framework \u00b6 Our intervention also provided a structured methodology for educators, a roadmap to guide the orchestration of these diverse learning collectives. By emphasizing the importance of interest and skill inventories, group formation, role assignment, and project design, we sought to imbue the educational process with a sense of purpose, reflection, and celebration. This framework was underpinned by the belief that every student\u2019s journey is unique, yet interconnected within the larger world of collective learning. Technology as a Catalyst \u00b6 A pivotal aspect of our project was the integration of Immersive technologies (AR/VR), transforming in this case, abstract mathematical concepts into tangible, interactive experiences. This not only made learning more engaging but also instilled a sense of wonder and curiosity, inviting students to explore the boundaries of their imagination. The experiences were carefully crafted to be age-appropriate, ensuring a safe and enriching learning environment. Reflecting on Design Philosophies \u00b6 This intervention resonated deeply with my design philosophy, particularly the notion of \u201cSelf reflexive activation or autoethnographic practices.\u201d By engaging with students\u2019 lived experiences and interests, we sought to infuse the design process with principles like empathy and positionality, crafting educational experiences that are not only inclusive but transformative. It underscores the power of design to envision educational futures that are engaging, personalized, and deeply humanistic. Looking Ahead \u00b6 As we reflect on the accomplishments and learnings from this project, it\u2019s clear that we\u2019ve only scratched the surface of what\u2019s possible in reimagining education for the next generation. The journey ahead is ripe with potential for further exploration, innovation, and, most importantly, impact. This project has reinforced my belief in the transformative power of collaborative design, especially when it comes to crafting educational experiences that not only inform but inspire and empower.

This project, although a small-scale MVP, encapsulates the profound potential of integrating immersive technology with community engagement in design processes. It\u2019s a tangible demonstration of how we can democratize design, making it accessible and engaging for all members of a community, not just professionals. Empowerment through Immersive Technology \u00b6 The project\u2019s objective was clear from the start: to empower community members to actively participate in the design process of our communal spaces. By utilizing immersive technology, we\u2019ve not only opened up the design process but have also provided a platform for community voices to be heard and visualized in real-time. This approach transforms the traditional, often exclusive, design process into an inclusive, collaborative experience, where the community\u2019s collective intelligence shapes our shared spaces. Facilitating User-centric Design Iterations \u00b6 The use of a 3D scanner to capture the spatial dimensions of the roof area was a crucial first step, laying the groundwork for what was to become a series of inclusive design iterations. By importing these scans into Gravity Sketch and integrating feedback from community members through Procreate and Adobe Aero, we\u2019ve showcased a seamless blend of technology and human insight. This iterative process, supported by AR technology, not only enhances the design quality but also ensures that the final output resonates with the users\u2019 needs and preferences. The Role of AR in Collaborative Design \u00b6 The integration of AR technology through Adobe Aero presented a groundbreaking opportunity to visualize proposed designs within the actual physical space. This aspect of our project underscores the potential of AR in making design processes more interactive and tangible. The ability to scan a QR code and immediately see the potential transformations of a space bridges the gap between abstract ideas and concrete realities, making civic participation not just productive but also delightful. Reflections on Civic Engagement and Participation \u00b6 This project stands as a testament to the evolving landscape of civic engagement in design processes. The enthusiastic participation of our fellow students, their willingness to engage with new technologies, and the collective creativity unleashed during this project are indicative of a broader shift towards more open, collaborative design methodologies. By facilitating an environment where civic engagement and participation are not only easier but also more productive, we\u2019re stepping into a future where design processes are inherently more democratic and inclusive. Looking Forward \u00b6 As we look forward to expanding on this MVP, the possibilities for more complex, co-created projects are endless. The integration of AI in the development of these projects can further streamline the collaborative process, making it more efficient and effective. This project has laid the groundwork for a new era of design, where technology empowers communities to actively shape their environments, creating spaces that are not only functional but also deeply reflective of the community\u2019s identity and values. \u201cHow Might We?\u201d Questions Moving Forward \u00b6 As we venture into the second part of the microchallenge, several \u201cHow Might We?\u201d questions emerge to guide our exploration and ensure the continuation of this innovative approach to design: How might we leverage collaborative play to make the design process more engaging and foster a deeper sense of community ownership? How might we facilitate asynchronous co-creation, allowing participants to contribute to projects on their own schedule, while still maintaining a cohesive design vision? How might we use immersive tech to visualize the potential impacts of design choices on the environment and community well-being in real-time? How might we build on the insights from this microchallenge to create a scalable model for collaborative urban development projects worldwide? How might we incorporate feedback mechanisms into the AR experience, enabling a dynamic and iterative design process that evolves based on community input? How might we design intuitive platforms that enable people of varying skill levels to express their ideas both verbally and visually, ensuring that technical jargon doesn\u2019t hinder their participation? How might we create engaging and accessible entry points for individuals who are aware of urban problems and motivated to contribute, overcoming the barrier of feeling powerless against systemic issues? How might we craft compelling narratives that transform apathy into action for those who know about urban problems but choose not to engage, showing them the direct impact their involvement could have? This project, while a small-scale MVP, sets the stage for a broader dialogue on the future of collaborative design. It challenges us to reimagine the possibilities of civic engagement, making the process of shaping our urban environments more inclusive, democratic, and creative than ever before.","title":"Microchallenge 1"},{"location":"term2/09-Microchallenges/09-Microchallenge%201/#microchallenge-collaborative-design-participation-with-immersive-tech","text":"","title":"Microchallenge- Collaborative Design Participation with Immersive Tech"},{"location":"term2/09-Microchallenges/09-Microchallenge%201/#dhrishya-ramadass-and-jorge-dlm","text":"","title":"Dhrishya Ramadass and Jorge DLM"},{"location":"term2/09-Microchallenges/09-Microchallenge%201/#reflection","text":"Reflecting on the \u201cMicrochallenge- Collaborative Design Participation with Immersive Tech\u201d project, I find myself deeply engrossed in the implications of what we\u2019ve accomplished and what it signifies for the future of collaborative design processes.

While many of our classmates engaged directly with the tactile and visual elements of the landscape, Carmen Robres and I chose to channel our experiences through an auditory lens, translating the essence of Angoustrine into music. A Different Mode of Expression \u00b6 The decision to reinterpret our first-person perspective experiences into a musical composition stemmed from a desire to explore a non-visual medium that could equally capture the profound impact of our surroundings. This approach allowed us to delve deeper into the emotional and sensorial facets of our journey, particularly during our extensive hike through the varied landscapes of the Angoustrine Valley. Collaboration and Inspiration \u00b6 Working closely with Carmen in the library at the beautiful Grande Maison Rouge, our partnership was instrumental in shaping the final outcome.

Working with Marius, Sophie, and Carlotta, we dove straight into dissecting and expanding the Atlas of Weak Signals (AOWS). The process was practical and insightful, guiding us to create new weak signal cards that dove deeper than just scratching the surface. It was an effective brainstorming session that brought to light some compelling ideas, and it reinforced my dedication to the AOWS project. Our group tackled signals that neatly aligned with the original set, covering topics like Digital Twin technology, Large Action Models, AI in decision-making, global polarization, and the rise of new all-encompassing platforms. Our final output\u2014cards like Co-Ownership Revolution and Planet-Centered AI Governance\u2014really captured the essence of today\u2019s intertwined complexities. While my original reservations about the way the AOWS include the other foresight tools( we\u2019re missing strong signals, drivers of change, critical uncertainties, scenarios), I think the freshness rating we\u2019re introducing might just be the right kind of filter we need. It could help us in a second run to hone these cards to focus more sharply on the change drivers without leaning towards any particular type of future. The workshop\u2019s steps were well laid out, from jotting down our contextual data in Activity 01 to defining and breaking down our topics in Activity 02. When we reached Activity 03, piecing together the clusters into the CIPHER template, we got a clear picture of the different impacts on our theme\u2019s future. The prototyping in Activity 05 allowed us to get creative and tactile with our ideas. And finally, positioning our themes within the physical space in Activity 06 was an engaging way to wrap up our session.

Working with Marius, Sophie, and Carlotta, we dove straight into dissecting and expanding the Atlas of Weak Signals (AOWS). The process was practical and insightful, guiding us to create new weak signal cards that dove deeper than just scratching the surface. It was an effective brainstorming session that brought to light some compelling ideas, and it reinforced my dedication to the AOWS project. Our group tackled signals that neatly aligned with the original set, covering topics like Digital Twin technology, Large Action Models, AI in decision-making, global polarization, and the rise of new all-encompassing platforms. Our final output\u2014cards like Co-Ownership Revolution and Planet-Centered AI Governance\u2014really captured the essence of today\u2019s intertwined complexities. While my original reservations about the way the AOWS include the other foresight tools( we\u2019re missing strong signals, drivers of change, critical uncertainties, scenarios), I think the freshness rating we\u2019re introducing might just be the right kind of filter we need. It could help us in a second run to hone these cards to focus more sharply on the change drivers without leaning towards any particular type of future. The workshop\u2019s steps were well laid out, from jotting down our contextual data in Activity 01 to defining and breaking down our topics in Activity 02. When we reached Activity 03, piecing together the clusters into the CIPHER template, we got a clear picture of the different impacts on our theme\u2019s future. The prototyping in Activity 05 allowed us to get creative and tactile with our ideas. And finally, positioning our themes within the physical space in Activity 06 was an engaging way to wrap up our session. This workshop validated a critical point for me: the AOWS can draw from various techniques for content generation. However, its true strength lies in the collaborative process\u2014a collective effort that brings diverse perspectives into a unified, actionable format.

The class really captured my interest in understanding how objects, designs, and technology do more than just serve a function\u2014they tell stories about where we are as a society and where we\u2019re headed. I was especially amused and intrigued by the connections to Tim Scanlon\u2019s \u201cWhat We Owe to Each Other,\u201d which was humorously introduced in \u201cThe Good Place.\u201d It\u2019s a fun way to dive into some pretty deep moral philosophy. Multistability: Technology\u2019s Multiple Meanings \u00b6 One concept that really stuck with me is Don Ihde\u2019s idea of multistability. It\u2019s fascinating how a single piece of technology can have multiple uses and meanings depending on the context. For example, a self-tracking app can help someone stay fit but can also become a tool for self-surveillance. This idea made me realize how versatile and complex technology really is, and how it\u2019s not just about the design itself but about how people use it in their daily lives. This concept aligns so well with the approach of the Master in Design for Emergent Futures (MDEF) program, which emphasizes creating designs that can adapt to various scenarios and solve real-world problems. The Jevons Paradox: Efficiency and Consumption \u00b6 The Jevons Paradox was another eye-opener for me. It challenges the common assumption that making something more efficient will naturally lead to less resource consumption. Instead, it can sometimes lead to more consumption, which is a bit of a paradox. This made me think about the broader impacts of design decisions and the importance of considering sustainability from all angles. It\u2019s not just about making things more efficient but also about understanding the ripple effects of those improvements. Herbert A. Simon: Normative Design \u00b6 Herbert A. Simon\u2019s perspective on design was another highlight. His idea that design is about how things ought to be, rather than just how they are, resonated deeply with me. It emphasizes the proactive role designers play in shaping a better future. This ties in perfectly with the MDEF program\u2019s focus on creating interventions that make a real difference. Simon\u2019s work on design thinking\u2014emphasizing empathy, creativity, and experimentation\u2014really hit home as it aligns with my belief that design should address complex problems in innovative ways. Ethical Frameworks: Kant and Utilitarianism \u00b6 Connecting these philosophical ideas to Tim Scanlon\u2019s work in \u201cWhat We Owe to Each Other\u201d added another layer of depth. Scanlon\u2019s focus on the moral principles guiding our interactions with others made me think about the broader implications of design. It\u2019s not just about making something look good or work well; it\u2019s about considering how it impacts people\u2019s lives and whether it contributes positively to society. Exploring ethical frameworks like Kant\u2019s Categorical Imperative and utilitarianism provided a solid foundation for thinking about the moral aspects of design. Kant\u2019s principle about acting in ways that could be universal laws and treating people as ends in themselves offers valuable guidance for making ethical design decisions. It challenges us to think about the broader impact of our work and to ensure that our designs respect and enhance human dignity. Utilitarianism, which focuses on maximizing happiness and minimizing suffering, provided another perspective. However, applying it to real-world scenarios can be tricky, as it involves balancing benefits and harms. This made me aware of the complexities involved in ethical decision-making and the need for a careful, balanced approach. Virtue Ethics and Care Ethics \u00b6 The discussions on virtue ethics and care ethics added even more to my understanding. Virtue ethics, with its emphasis on character and good habits, reminded me that being a good designer is about more than just following rules or calculating outcomes\u2014it\u2019s about consistently striving to do good. Care ethics, focusing on relationships and the well-being of others, emphasized the importance of empathy and support, which are crucial in creating inclusive and human-centered designs. Decolonization and Alternative Well-Being \u00b6 Lastly, the conversations about decolonization and alternative notions of well-being, like Sumak Kawsay, broadened my perspective. These ideas challenged dominant Western views and offered insights into more holistic and community-focused approaches to well-being. They emphasized the importance of respecting indigenous knowledge and practices, which is crucial for creating designs that are not only innovative but also culturally sensitive and sustainable. Conclusion \u00b6 In conclusion, this design ethics class has been a transformative experience for me. It has given me a deeper appreciation of the ethical dimensions of design and technology. I feel more aware of the complex interplay between design, human values, and societal development. This awareness will guide me in creating more ethical, inclusive, and sustainable designs. The class has inspired me to think deeply about my role as a designer and the impact of my work, reminding me that ethical design is about making the world a better place. This reflection aligns perfectly with the MDEF program\u2019s vision of using design to tackle the wicked problems of our time, fostering innovation, sustainability, and ethical responsibility. Self-Assessment on Technology and Design Reflection \u00b6 Numerical Mark: 8/10 \u00b6 Personal Reflection \u00b6 Over the course of this design ethics class, I have developed a deeper understanding of the intricate relationship between technology, design, and ethical considerations. My self-assessment reflects both my learning journey and the outcomes achieved, which I believe warrant a mark of 8 out of 10. Here\u2019s a detailed reflection on why I\u2019ve given myself this score: Strengths and Achievements \u00b6 Grasp of Multistability (9/10) I have developed a solid understanding of Don Ihde\u2019s concept of multistability, recognizing the fluidity and adaptability of technology in different contexts. This concept has broadened my perspective on how designs can be interpreted and utilized in multiple ways, leading to a more inclusive and versatile approach to design.

These perspectives have reinforced my commitment to creating empathetic and human-centered designs. Exploration of Decolonization and Alternative Well-Being (8/10) I have broadened my perspective by exploring decolonization and alternative notions of well-being, such as Sumak Kawsay. This exploration has deepened my appreciation for culturally sensitive and sustainable design practices. Areas for Improvement \u00b6 Integrating Ethical Frameworks More Seamlessly (7/10) While I have a good grasp of various ethical frameworks, I need to work on integrating these principles more fluidly into my design process. This includes balancing conflicting interests and making nuanced decisions that consider long-term impacts. Practical Application of Theoretical Knowledge (7/10) Translating theoretical knowledge into practical design interventions remains a challenge. I need to focus on applying what I\u2019ve learned in real-world scenarios to better bridge the gap between theory and practice. Enhancing Reflective Practice (8/10) Although I engage in reflective practice, there is room for improvement in consistently documenting and analyzing my reflections. This will help me better understand my design choices and their ethical implications over time. Conclusion \u00b6 Overall, I feel confident in the knowledge and skills I\u2019ve acquired through this design ethics class. The mark of 8 out of 10 reflects my solid understanding and application of ethical principles, while also acknowledging the areas where I can continue to grow and improve. My journey in design ethics is ongoing, and I am committed to further developing my capabilities to create designs that are not only innovative but also ethically sound and culturally sensitive.","title":"Multistability and Morality"},{"location":"term3/03-Philosophy-and-Ethics-in-Design/01-Multistability%20and%20Morality/#multistability-and-morality-designing-for-a-better-future","text":"Reflecting on my design ethics class, I can\u2019t help but feel deeply inspired by the ideas we explored and how they connect to the world around us.

My exposure to speculative fiction and scientific media has led me to similar realizations that are now being reinforced by philosophy-heavy classes. The works of Carl Sagan, Donna Haraway, and Lynn Margulis offer complementary perspectives that help construct a more complete vision of our world and our place within it. Collective Thinking and Multi-Species Coexistence \u00b6 The idea that \u201cnobody thinks alone\u201d is a fundamental insight I\u2019ve encountered repeatedly. Haraway emphasizes that we must move beyond individualism to understand our roles within a multi-species world. This is mirrored in Sagan\u2019s reflections on Earth as a fragile, shared home. Watching \u201cCosmos\u201d and reading \u201cPale Blue Dot,\u201d I was struck by Sagan\u2019s emphasis on our interconnectedness and the need for collective care. These insights have shaped my approach to design, pushing me to consider the broader ecological and social systems in which my interventions will exist. Symbiosis and Interdependence \u00b6 Lynn Margulis\u2019 concept of symbiosis, particularly in \u201cSymbiotic Planet,\u201d highlights how life thrives through interconnected relationships. This idea was echoed in Sagan\u2019s exploration of the interconnectedness of life, where he discusses how different forms of life depend on and support each other. Understanding these symbiotic relationships is crucial in my work as a designer, where promoting these interactions can lead to more resilient and adaptive systems. This perspective encourages me to design with an awareness of the ecological networks and the symbiotic relationships that sustain life. Challenging the Anthropocene and Human Exceptionalism \u00b6 Our class discussions on the Anthropocene and human exceptionalism challenge the notion that humans are separate from or superior to other forms of life. Haraway critiques the Anthropocene as a universal concept, arguing that it obscures the varied impacts of human activities across different regions. This resonates with Sagan\u2019s challenge to human exceptionalism, where he emphasizes our small place in the vast cosmos. These ideas push me to adopt a more humble and inclusive approach in my design practice, recognizing the contributions of non-human entities and the importance of protecting our shared environment. Cultivating Response-Ability \u00b6 Haraway\u2019s concept of \u201cresponse-ability\u201d focuses on cultivating the capacity to respond thoughtfully and ethically to both human and non-human entities. This idea is critical in the MDEF program, where we are encouraged to develop interventions that are not only responsible but also responsive to the needs of various life forms. Sagan\u2019s emphasis on critical thinking and skepticism, as seen in \u201cThe Demon-Haunted World,\u201d complements this approach. Both thinkers advocate for a science-based understanding of our world, encouraging us to move beyond simplistic or dogmatic views. Integrating Perspectives for a Holistic Vision \u00b6 Integrating the ecological insights of Haraway, the symbiotic principles of Margulis, and the scientific perspective of Sagan creates a rich framework for understanding our world. This holistic approach enhances my ability to develop interventions that are innovative, ecologically conscious, and socially inclusive. By embracing multi-species coexistence, symbiosis, and response-ability, I am better equipped to contribute to a more sustainable and interconnected future. Personal Reflections on the Journey \u00b6 My journey as a designer and futurist has been deeply influenced by consuming speculative fiction and scientific media. Watching shows like \u201cStar Trek\u201d and reading books by Carl Sagan, such as \u201cCosmos,\u201d \u201cPale Blue Dot,\u201d and \u201cThe Dragons of Eden,\u201d have profoundly shaped my understanding of our interconnected world. These experiences, combined with the insights from our philosophy-heavy classes, have led me to a deeper appreciation of the complexity and beauty of life. These realizations have fundamentally altered my approach to design. I now see my work not just as creating isolated solutions but as fostering relationships within a larger ecological and social context. This perspective encourages me to think beyond the immediate impact of my designs and consider their long-term effects on the environment and society. Moving Forward \u00b6 Reflecting on these themes, I see how my past knowledge and recent learnings form a comprehensive vision of the world. This synergy between scientific inquiry and ecological mindfulness enriches my understanding and guides my work in the MDEF program. By integrating these diverse perspectives, I aim to create meaningful interventions that promote the collective well-being of all life forms on our planet. This approach not only aligns with my personal journey but also represents a holistic and inclusive way of thinking about and designing for the future.","title":"Speculative Thinking to decolonize the future"},{"location":"term3/03-Philosophy-and-Ethics-in-Design/02-Speculative%20Thinking/#connecting-my-journey-as-a-designer-and-futurist-with-haraway-margulis-and-sagans-philosophies","text":"Reflecting on our recent class discussions, I find a powerful resonance between the concepts we explored and the ideas I\u2019ve encountered in my journey as a designer and futurist.

This approach not only aligns with my personal journey but also represents a holistic and inclusive way of thinking about and designing for the future.","title":"Moving Forward"},{"location":"term3/03-Philosophy-and-Ethics-in-Design/03-DeSein/","text":"Communicating Ideas Through Narrative \u00b6 Reflecting on Laura Benitez\u2019s insights on narrative and storytelling, I\u2019ve come to appreciate how narratives are not just stories with a beginning, middle, and end. Instead, they are complex structures composed of multiple voices and perspectives, much like the interventions we design. As a designer and futurist, this approach to narrative deeply resonates with my practice of crafting interventions that aim to convey complex ideas and foster understanding among diverse audiences. The Power of Narrative \u00b6 Narrative, as Jerome Bruner suggests, is a powerful epistemic tool. It imposes meaning on the world, shaping how we understand and explain our experiences. This is particularly relevant in our current era, often described as the post-truth era, where narratives are used to create conceptions that might not always be based on certainty or rigorousness. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for us as designers because it emphasizes the responsibility we hold in shaping narratives that are truthful and impactful. Staying with the Narrative \u00b6 Walter Benjamin, in his essay \u201cThe Storyteller,\u201d highlights the importance of allowing a story to speak for itself without forcing a psychological connection on the reader. This concept of leaving room for interpretation is vital in designing interventions. It allows the audience to engage with the narrative personally and draw their own meanings, thus achieving a depth that mere information cannot. De_Sein: An Example of Narrative in Design \u00b6 The \u201cDe_Sein\u201d installation is a profound example of using narrative to explore philosophical concepts. This project addresses Heidegger\u2019s concept of Dasein, focusing on the unique existential condition of humans and their capacity for reflection and care. By incorporating mycelium experiments, the installation creates a tangible network that symbolizes the symbiotic interdependence between different agents, both human and non-human. This approach not only makes the abstract concept of Dasein accessible but also invites the audience to rethink their relationships with others and their environment. Practical Application in Festival Storytelling \u00b6 In preparing for a festival, thinking of interventions as storytelling actions becomes essential. Each intervention can be seen as a narrative composed of multiple voices, each contributing to the overall story. For instance, a project might include elements such as interactive installations, multimedia presentations, and live performances, each adding a unique thread to the narrative. This multi-voiced approach ensures that the narrative is rich, dynamic, and engaging, allowing the audience to explore different perspectives and interpretations. Description of My Intervention for the Festival \u00b6 For the upcoming festival, I am planning an installation titled \u201cEchoes of the Future.\u201d This intervention will explore the interconnectedness of past, present, and future through a multi-sensory experience. The installation will feature: Interactive Projections: Historical images and futuristic scenarios projected onto walls, allowing visitors to interact with and manipulate the visuals, thus experiencing the fluidity of time. Soundscapes: A blend of archival recordings and speculative future sounds will create an immersive auditory experience, emphasizing the continuous thread of human experience. Narrative Stations: Small booths where visitors can listen to or read stories from different time periods, narrated by diverse voices. These stations will include personal anecdotes, scientific predictions, and philosophical reflections, highlighting the multiplicity of narratives that shape our understanding of time. Collaborative Mural: A large, evolving mural where visitors can contribute their visions of the future, creating a collective narrative that grows throughout the festival. Conclusion \u00b6 This approach to narrative and storytelling in design interventions aligns closely with the insights from our class and my journey as a designer and futurist. By considering interventions as multi-voiced narratives, we can create richer, more engaging experiences that invite audiences to explore, interpret, and connect with the ideas presented. This not only enhances the impact of our work but also fosters a deeper understanding and appreciation of the complex world we inhabit.","title":"Communicating Ideas Through Narrative"},{"location":"term3/03-Philosophy-and-Ethics-in-Design/03-DeSein/#communicating-ideas-through-narrative","text":"Reflecting on Laura Benitez\u2019s insights on narrative and storytelling, I\u2019ve come to appreciate how narratives are not just stories with a beginning, middle, and end.

Titled \u201cEl Pressentiment,\u201d this class challenged us to explore the philosophical and social constructs surrounding the body, identity, and gender, with a particular focus on their intersection with design. This exploration was incredibly relevant and prescient, especially when considering concepts like queerness and Donna Haraway\u2019s \u201cCyborg Manifesto,\u201d which continue to resonate strongly in today\u2019s context. Exploring the Body and Identity \u00b6 We began by examining historical perspectives on the body, particularly through the lens of Christian pastoral care and mechanistic views. This dualist ontology, which separates the soul and body, helped us understand the stigmatization of the body and its treatment as a machine. The shift towards phenomenology, especially through Husserl and Merleau-Ponty, introduced the idea of the body as a center of intentionality, where our physical being is intrinsically linked to our interaction with the world. This perspective was both enlightening and transformative, reshaping my understanding of how we perceive our bodies. The Impact of Phenomenology and Ontological Monism \u00b6 The discussion of ontological monism, which views the world as a singular, unified entity, offered a stark contrast to dualism. It challenged us to rethink the nature of reality and the interconnectedness of our experiences. Heidegger\u2019s teachings further deepened this understanding by highlighting how our vision and actions are codified by the context in which we exist. This holistic view of existence was a revelation, emphasizing the fluidity and interconnectedness of our lived experiences. Integrating Critical Theory and Gender Studies \u00b6 A significant portion of the class was dedicated to critical theory and gender studies, focusing on the works of Lacan, Foucault, and Butler. Lacan\u2019s mirror theory and Foucault\u2019s ideas on subjectivity and power structures provided a framework for understanding how identities are formed and controlled. Butler\u2019s exploration of performativity and the materiality of the body offered a nuanced view of gender as a series of performative acts, shaped by societal norms but also possessing the potential for subversion and redefinition. These theories were not just academic exercises but powerful tools for analyzing and challenging the status quo. Transfeminism and New Feminisms \u00b6 The class also delved into transfeminism, a branch of new feminisms that expands the subjects of feminism to include those oppressed by cisheteropatriarchy, beyond cisgender women. This perspective emphasizes that gender is a social construct used to oppress and exclude, advocating for the recognition of an infinite number of gender identities. It highlights the privileges accorded to cisgender individuals and critiques the binary gender system, advocating for a more inclusive approach that acknowledges the diverse experiences of all gender identities. This inclusive perspective felt revolutionary, pushing us to envision a more equitable world. Practical Application and Reflection \u00b6 The class was not just theoretical but also deeply reflective. We engaged in exercises to understand our own identities and how we communicate them through our work. This included exploring brand stories and values, which was initially challenging but ultimately rewarding as it helped clarify the core takeaways of our projects. This process of reflection and articulation is crucial for effectively communicating our ideas and values to others. The practical application of these concepts reinforced their relevance and impact on our design practices. Conclusion \u00b6 Overall, this class has been very important in shaping my understanding of the interplay between design, identity, and gender. It has reinforced the importance of considering the socio-political context in which design operates and the power dynamics that influence it. By integrating critical theory with practical design principles, the class has provided a holistic approach to creating more inclusive and thoughtful design solutions. As I continue my journey in the Master in Design for Emergent Futures program, these insights will undoubtedly inform and enrich my work, inspiring me to challenge conventional boundaries and contribute to a more inclusive future.","title":"Critical Transfeminist Design"},{"location":"term3/04-Critical-Transfeminist-Design/01-Critical%20Transfeminist%20Design/#reflecting-on-my-critical-transfeminist-design-class","text":"My recent experience in the Critical Transfeminist Design class with Laura at Elisava has been profoundly eye-opening and thought-provoking.

We learned to account for material limitations and the specifics of CNC milling, ensuring that our design was both feasible and structurally sound. The necessity of testing and adjusting, particularly with the connectors, emphasized the need for flexibility and problem-solving skills in digital fabrication. Using Gravity Sketch for initial modeling proved invaluable in quickly assessing proportions and refining our design. Future: \u00b6 Looking forward, I plan to incorporate the lessons learned from this project into future design endeavors. Testing components before full-scale production will be a priority to minimize errors. The combination of digital modeling and physical prototyping proved invaluable, and I will continue to refine these skills to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of my design process. Reflection Summary \u00b6 This experience was an excellent exercise in merging physical design with digital fabrication. It reinforced the value of collaboration and iterative design, showcasing how modern technology can bring creative ideas to life. Working with Carlotta on this project was not only educational but also inspiring, encouraging us to push the boundaries of what we could achieve within the constraints we faced. Final Product and Reflections \u00b6 The final product exceeded our expectations, both in terms of design and functionality. The chair\u2019s sleek, modern look complemented its comfortable, semi-leaning posture.

Our goal was to connect these algorithms to physical sensors to produce meaningful outputs based on the data received. This exploration provided a fascinating insight into the intersection of sensor technology and machine learning, offering a unique challenge and a break from my usual thesis work. Facts: \u00b6 In this module, we were tasked with creating a soft sensor capable of detecting pressure changes. The sensor was made using conductive fabric, felt, and conductive tape. The data from the sensor was then sent to Wekinator for training, where we categorized the pressure levels. Once trained, we connected the data to Max/MSP to visualize the pressure changes via a neopixel LED mounted on a Barduino board. The LED color shifted from green to red as the pressure increased, providing a clear visual representation of the sensor\u2019s functionality. Feelings: \u00b6 This module was both challenging and enlightening. I felt a mix of excitement and frustration as we worked to calibrate the sensor and train the model.

In Max/MSP, these values controlled various musical parameters such as volume, pitch, and effects, creating a responsive and interactive musical controller. Feelings: \u00b6 Working on this project alone was both challenging and rewarding. I felt a sense of satisfaction when I successfully integrated the flexible sensor with Wekinator and Max/MSP. Although there were some difficulties with sensor calibration and data transmission, solving these issues was fulfilling. Seeing the system respond to pressure inputs by altering musical parameters and generating corresponding visual effects was particularly gratifying. Findings: \u00b6 This project highlighted the importance of iterative testing and calibration in developing functional prototypes. I learned how to effectively use Wekinator to train machine learning models and Max/MSP for creating audiovisual outputs. This experience also demonstrated the versatility of flexible sensors and their potential applications in interactive media and music technology. Future: \u00b6 In future projects, I plan to further explore the use of flexible sensors with machine learning and audiovisual systems. Ensuring precise calibration and robust data collection will be crucial. I am looking forward to experimenting with more complex sensor configurations and developing interactive installations that respond to different environmental inputs. The skills gained from this project will be useful in future explorations of sensor technology and digital prototyping. Project Summary \u00b6 In this module, we used a system using a flexible pressure sensor as a musical controller.

The experience was based on the electoral promises of political parties during the week of Catalan elections, displaying both current and hypothetical transformations influenced by urban mobility proposals. Project Conception and Goals: The primary objective of this project was to enable participants to experience, first-hand, future urban development scenarios through VR. By visualizing the present state of Plaza Espanya alongside eight envisioned futures, the project sought to provoke thought and gather feedback on urban mobility changes proposed by different political parties. The ultimate goal was to engage participants in a voting process to identify the most favored urban future, providing a unique, interactive way to reflect on potential urban transformations. Development Process: The development of the Portals project involved multiple phases, from ideation to execution, focusing on creating a seamless and engaging VR experience. Key aspects included: Initial Setup: Asset Integration: We began by integrating high-quality images and audio files into the VR scene, setting the stage for a compelling visual and auditory experience. Scene Navigation: Implementing intuitive navigation within the VR environment was crucial, allowing users to easily switch between current and future scenarios. Iterative Improvements: Button Interactivity: A significant challenge was ensuring that buttons were only active when visible. Initially, the \u201cStart\u201d button remained active in the scenario view, causing unintended behavior. This was addressed by carefully managing the button states, disabling them when not in use. Audio Management: Managing audio tracks efficiently was critical. We ensured that audio did not restart unnecessarily when switching between current and future images within the same scenario, and introduced a mute button to control audio playback effectively. Visual and User Experience: Adjustments were made to improve the UI, ensuring that the buttons were spaced sensibly and that primary actions were clearly distinguishable. User Voting Mechanism: The integration of a voting mechanism allowed participants to select their preferred scenario after experiencing the VR content. This interactive element not only engaged users but also provided valuable insights into their preferences. Key Learnings: 1. Modular Code and Custom Events: Utilizing custom events for handling scenario transitions and button interactions enhanced code modularity and maintainability. This approach allowed for cleaner, more organized code structures, facilitating easier management and future extensions. Component-Based Architecture: Leveraging A-Frame\u2019s component-based architecture enabled the creation of reusable components for functionalities such as button interactions and audio controls. This approach significantly improved the scalability and maintainability of the project. Responsive Design: Ensuring the VR experience was accessible on various devices was essential. We employed media queries and A-Frame\u2019s responsive components to adjust the layout and functionality based on the device, ensuring a seamless user experience across platforms. Scenario Examples: \u00b6 Outcome and Reflections: The voting results from our classmates revealed interesting preferences and insights into the scenarios. We received a lot of detailed feedback on why people voted the way they did. Many users pointed out specific details they didn\u2019t like, which influenced their choice. For instance, one local classmate mentioned that seeing certain buildings transformed made her dislike some representations, even though she appreciated other aspects of the scenarios. These insights were invaluable, offering a glimpse into collective perceptions and priorities regarding urban mobility. The project demonstrated the importance of iterative development, user-centered design, and responsive implementation. By addressing the challenges and iterating on solutions, we were able to create an engaging and informative VR experience that aligned with the goals of the MDEF program. This project underscored the value of integrating technical skills with design thinking to produce meaningful and interactive digital experiences. Creating an immersive voting experience based on the potential impact of each political party\u2019s electoral program was a daring but rewarding experiment. The technology and insights gained from this project will likely play a crucial role in the development of my final project. This journey has not only provided me with practical skills but also deepened my understanding of how immersive technologies can influence and reflect public opinion on urban mobility futures. Conclusion: Using VR to achieve the goal of creating an experience based on feedback was an interesting take for sure, and although it was different from other classmates\u2019 projects, it was an incredible dive into the world of coding and getting consistent results, especially for a project done in less than 5 days.

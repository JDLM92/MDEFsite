Prototyping excercise \u00b6 For one of our first exercises, we shared past projects with our group, and exchanged them to re-think them with a new perspective. My fellow student Ever, talked about a project in his architecture degree, where they proposed the famously exclusive University to open a new passageway through a wall that leads to a barrio that usually houses foreign students, and they prefer walking since they are very close. Problem is, this university is extremely car-centric in it\u2019s approach to entrances and exits, and since these entrances are only for people associated with the university, anyone wanting walk through it cannot, and instead has to walk around the university. So in my re-imagined design project, the new gate has a very chaotic, and frankly dystopic solution for non-university related people to be able to go through: to be enveloped in a human sized plastic bubble, so they can walk across campus, and only be able to leave the bubble, once they cross to the other side. To be fair (....) this is obviously a very exaggerated solution, but I find it would really emphasize the university\u2019s policies of only letting alumni and related people inside, unlike universities in Europe, for example. Reflection \u00b6 I think this was a very interesting excercise since we were allowed to create more \u2018Critical Design\u2019 type solutions to other people\u2019s projects, which is why I allowed myself to create such aggressive and frankly crazy solution for Everardo\u2019s University project. Personal RtD Toolbox \u00b6 I\u2019ve downloaded some of my Skills, Tools, People, and places to this RtD Toolbox, but I figured I\u2019ll keep updating it as the course keeps going, since I feel like I\u2019m learning so much, including how to finally connect some diverging learning streaks I\u2019ve made in various subjects into a more tangible project. Shared Design Space and Design Intervention \u00b6 This project has been very intense since it\u2019s been running in parallel to other projects. Our initial ambitions were demolished as time passed, but we ended up learning some really valuable information that with maybe a bit more time we will be able to understand and help shape our future strategy regarding waste disposal systems. Initially our ideas revolved around getting interesting data from waste disposal companies, maybe even data that they were not collecting themselves, our idea revolving around identifying where in the city waste was being separated properly with the goal of reducing strain in the \u201ccircularity\u201d of Barcelona. After our visit at Urbaser, where we were given a great chat about the current effort that they are making, and some interesting insights into the current system of waste disposal of the city, we were also given the privilege of visiting the green roof of their building, which was an amazing experience, and expecially coming from the man himself, Joan Bosch, who was granted 100k euro from the government to fund the exploration of this very interesting idea for wellbeing and temperature management. In the end, we learned that much of what we thought would be possible, was either already being tested, or simply unfeasable for our timeframe, so we decided to refocus our intervention between two ways of affecting the current system: 1. To better understand and 2. To better educate Since our intention is to make a ding in the current way of doing things we have to acknowledge the variables that make it what it is, in this case, we learned that 59% of the waste disposed is thrown in the \u2018resta\u2019 bin, meaning more than half the waste thrown away was not separated properly. We decided to intervene this system, by learning of what is being done already, and the behavioral nudge that is being implemented falls on the premise that anonymity means people will not care to separate waste properly, but in my personal opinion, having to look over every person disposing of waste is maybe not the best long term solution, so we decided education and public participation was the goal, meaning we would have to find a way to Educate our fellow citizens so they understand why they must try to separate their waste better, instead of imposing more rules to do it. Our final solution is to have an always evolving set of informational outlets to keep the public updated on the best way to reduce their impact in the circularity of the city, this set consists of an Instagram page called BinGo , where we explain which bin to use for different types of waste in four different languages, aswell as an infographic focused data outlet where we periodically inform the citizens of Barcelona of the current best way to be informed about the circular system.

And why did it matter? \u00b6 The most basic version of an immersive song learning / music creation experience. Since there is not much immersive content yet, it\u2019s a great way to understand where the current technology lies, and where it might still grow in terms of personalized experiences for learning. What happens when you involve yourself? \u00b6 Experience first hand the complexity of making such experiences happen, including hand tracking, and thinking about what the next version of that would be for this specific purpose. I can easily notice the lack of tracking for the shapes of my fingers is off-putting, but being able to feel like I\u2019m in the room with the other person makes the song learning that much easier. What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? \u00b6 Being an instrument to learn how people play instruments is a funny thought. I\u2019d say that the next generations of musicians will have such an amazing tool at their disposal than what my generation had, and even more compared to past generations. From youtube learning, to immersive learning. Did anything change about your way of working? \u00b6 If I could do the entire songwriting and recording process in an immersive computing experience, I think it could get to a point where what used to be a very expensive way to make things in the past (abbey road records for example), will now be a trivial thing to experience for music production, and any creative task for that matter. What does it mean for your future work? \u00b6 I can see myself being very into creating these sort of specific immersive experiences to elevate what the current process of creating is, to a higher form of situated environment for creativity. After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration? \u00b6 It opens up a whole new world for collaboration if done right. I no longer believe this tech might die in the technology adoption chasm, because the minute people see the possibilities that these tech offers, it will no longer be an unreachable tech, but a countdown to when everyone can access experiences that almost no one had access to before.","title":"First Person Perspective Research"},{"location":"term1/06-Living-With-Your-Own-Ideas/02-First%20Person%20Perspective%20Research/#using-a-meta-quest-2-to-prototype-immersive-song-learning-with-the-current-mainstream-headset","text":"","title":"Using a Meta Quest 2 to prototype Immersive song learning with the current mainstream headset."},{"location":"term1/06-Living-With-Your-Own-Ideas/02-First%20Person%20Perspective%20Research/#what-did-you-make-and-why-did-it-matter","text":"The most basic version of an immersive song learning / music creation experience.

Making a GMO for our final project really made me think about how these technologies affect the real world. This course opened my mind a lot and showed me how important it is to combine different areas of study to solve big problems.

From the get-go with Pau Artigas at the helm, we didn\u2019t just skim the surface of AI; we dove headfirst into its deep and murky waters. Day 2 was all about getting our heads around the tech side of things. We delved into neural networks, datasets, training, and models. It was like piecing together a complex jigsaw puzzle, with each part \u2013 neural networks with their self-configuration mojo, diverse datasets, the nitty-gritty of training, and the final model \u2013 coming together to form a complete picture. It\u2019s fascinating how these networks configure themselves based on examples, and how the type of data they work with (be it images, text, or sound) shapes their learning. Then, Day 3 had us exploring the enigmatic world of Latent Spaces. Imagine a realm where data points are not just data points, but multi-dimensional representations capturing the essence of the data. It\u2019s like stepping into a parallel universe where everything you thought you knew about data gets a whole new meaning. What really got me thinking was the exercise on datasets. It was an eye-opener, making us critically analyze and choose datasets that resonated with us for various reasons \u2013 be it their utility, curiosity, or the potential issues they presented. It pushed us to think beyond the usual and consider the impact of the data we feed into these AI systems. Throughout the course, we kept circling back to the foundational models, grounding our understanding in the solid bedrock of AI concepts. It\u2019s like having a trusty map while navigating the often-confusing terrain of AI technologies. In all of this, the ethical and social implications of AI were never far from our minds. It was like having a moral compass guiding us through our journey, ensuring we didn\u2019t lose sight of the bigger picture \u2013 the impact of AI on society and our responsibility towards it. As we wrapped up the course, it was clear that our understanding of AI had evolved.

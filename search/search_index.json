During \u201cLanding Week\u201d, it set the tone for what\u2019s to come, blending a unique mix of familiarization and intensive learning. Right off the bat, my classmates stood out \u2013 a diverse group of enthusiastic individuals from varied backgrounds, each bringing a unique perspective to the table. Our educators wasted no time diving deep. Philosophy sessions stirred introspection and first-person research emphasized the essence of experiential narrative in design. The technical side wasn\u2019t neglected; grappling with Git sessions and mastering the art of documenting design marked the week. One week in, and it\u2019s evident \u2013 this journey will challenge conventions and redefine our horizons.

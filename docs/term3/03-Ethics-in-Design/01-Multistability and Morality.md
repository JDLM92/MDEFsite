# Multistability and Morality: Designing for a Better Future

Reflecting on my design ethics class, I can't help but feel deeply inspired by the ideas we explored and how they connect to the world around us. The class really captured my interest in understanding how objects, designs, and technology do more than just serve a function—they tell stories about where we are as a society and where we're headed. I was especially amused and intrigued by the connections to Tim Scanlon's "What We Owe to Each Other," which was humorously introduced in "The Good Place." It's a fun way to dive into some pretty deep moral philosophy.

## Multistability: Technology's Multiple Meanings

One concept that really stuck with me is Don Ihde’s idea of multistability. It’s fascinating how a single piece of technology can have multiple uses and meanings depending on the context. For example, a self-tracking app can help someone stay fit but can also become a tool for self-surveillance. This idea made me realize how versatile and complex technology really is, and how it's not just about the design itself but about how people use it in their daily lives. This concept aligns so well with the approach of the Master in Design for Emergent Futures (MDEF) program, which emphasizes creating designs that can adapt to various scenarios and solve real-world problems.

## The Jevons Paradox: Efficiency and Consumption

The Jevons Paradox was another eye-opener for me. It challenges the common assumption that making something more efficient will naturally lead to less resource consumption. Instead, it can sometimes lead to more consumption, which is a bit of a paradox. This made me think about the broader impacts of design decisions and the importance of considering sustainability from all angles. It’s not just about making things more efficient but also about understanding the ripple effects of those improvements.

## Herbert A. Simon: Normative Design

Herbert A. Simon’s perspective on design was another highlight. His idea that design is about how things ought to be, rather than just how they are, resonated deeply with me. It emphasizes the proactive role designers play in shaping a better future. This ties in perfectly with the MDEF program’s focus on creating interventions that make a real difference. Simon’s work on design thinking—emphasizing empathy, creativity, and experimentation—really hit home as it aligns with my belief that design should address complex problems in innovative ways.

## Ethical Frameworks: Kant and Utilitarianism

Connecting these philosophical ideas to Tim Scanlon’s work in "What We Owe to Each Other" added another layer of depth. Scanlon’s focus on the moral principles guiding our interactions with others made me think about the broader implications of design. It’s not just about making something look good or work well; it’s about considering how it impacts people’s lives and whether it contributes positively to society.

Exploring ethical frameworks like Kant’s Categorical Imperative and utilitarianism provided a solid foundation for thinking about the moral aspects of design. Kant’s principle about acting in ways that could be universal laws and treating people as ends in themselves offers valuable guidance for making ethical design decisions. It challenges us to think about the broader impact of our work and to ensure that our designs respect and enhance human dignity.

Utilitarianism, which focuses on maximizing happiness and minimizing suffering, provided another perspective. However, applying it to real-world scenarios can be tricky, as it involves balancing benefits and harms. This made me aware of the complexities involved in ethical decision-making and the need for a careful, balanced approach.

## Virtue Ethics and Care Ethics

The discussions on virtue ethics and care ethics added even more to my understanding. Virtue ethics, with its emphasis on character and good habits, reminded me that being a good designer is about more than just following rules or calculating outcomes—it’s about consistently striving to do good. Care ethics, focusing on relationships and the well-being of others, emphasized the importance of empathy and support, which are crucial in creating inclusive and human-centered designs.

## Decolonization and Alternative Well-Being

Lastly, the conversations about decolonization and alternative notions of well-being, like Sumak Kawsay, broadened my perspective. These ideas challenged dominant Western views and offered insights into more holistic and community-focused approaches to well-being. They emphasized the importance of respecting indigenous knowledge and practices, which is crucial for creating designs that are not only innovative but also culturally sensitive and sustainable.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this design ethics class has been a transformative experience for me. It has given me a deeper appreciation of the ethical dimensions of design and technology. I feel more aware of the complex interplay between design, human values, and societal development. This awareness will guide me in creating more ethical, inclusive, and sustainable designs. The class has inspired me to think deeply about my role as a designer and the impact of my work, reminding me that ethical design is about making the world a better place. This reflection aligns perfectly with the MDEF program’s vision of using design to tackle the wicked problems of our time, fostering innovation, sustainability, and ethical responsibility.

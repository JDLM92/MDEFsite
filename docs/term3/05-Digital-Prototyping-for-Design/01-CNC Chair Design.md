### Designing a CNC Chair
Over the course of several months, Carlotta Hylkema and I undertook a rewarding journey to design and fabricate a chair for our MDEF classroom. Our aim was to create a low, semi-leaning chair using CNC milling technology, seamlessly blending traditional craftsmanship with modern digital fabrication techniques. The result was a chair featuring two highly stylized side pieces, bridged by joint X cut pieces, with seating composed of crisscrossed nylon webbing akin to seatbelt material.


### Facts: 
The project began with a series of discussions and brainstorming sessions where we explored various chair designs, focusing on low chairs and rocking chairs for inspiration. We wanted to create a chair that would be both functional and aesthetically pleasing, suitable for relaxing during breaks in the classroom.

We started with initial sketches on paper, and as our ideas evolved, we identified a key sketch that captured the essence of our design vision. This sketch became the foundation for our digital modeling. I then modeled our initial ideas in Gravity Sketch, which provided a quick and intuitive way to measure proportions and visualize the chair in 3D. This step was crucial in refining our design before moving on to more detailed modeling in Rhino. The digital models allowed us to make necessary adjustments, considering the amount of available wood, CNC milling requirements, and the need for structural support.

Once we were confident in our digital model, we consulted with Adai to review the design and prepare the files for CNC milling. This preparation involved several critical steps:

Ensuring the holes for braces had appropriate tolerances.
Creating connecting joints to secure the braces in place.
Defining the depth and layers for the CNC machine to cut.
Clearly marking outer outlines, pockets, and holes.
The CNC milling process took about two hours, followed by sanding and assembly. The final step was threading the nylon webbing through the chair's structure.

Once our design was finalized, we consulted with Adai to prepare the CNC files. This involved ensuring proper tolerances for brace holes, creating secure connecting joints, and defining cutting depths and layers for the CNC machine. The milling process took about two hours, followed by sanding and assembly. The final step was threading the nylon webbing through the chair's structure.

### Feelings: 
Working on this project was both challenging and fun. Carlotta and I felt a sense of accomplishment as our digital designs gradually transformed into physical pieces. The assembly phase was particularly satisfying, seeing our efforts come together into a functional and aesthetically pleasing chair. There were moments of slight annoyance with the pieces, especially when dealing with the fit of the connectors, but overcoming these obstacles made the end result even more rewarding.

### Findings:
This project highlighted the importance of an iterative design process and careful planning. We learned to account for material limitations and the specifics of CNC milling, ensuring that our design was both feasible and structurally sound. The necessity of testing and adjusting, particularly with the connectors, emphasized the need for flexibility and problem-solving skills in digital fabrication. Using Gravity Sketch for initial modeling proved invaluable in quickly assessing proportions and refining our design.

### Future:
Looking forward, I plan to incorporate the lessons learned from this project into future design endeavors. Testing components before full-scale production will be a priority to minimize errors. The combination of digital modeling and physical prototyping proved invaluable, and I will continue to refine these skills to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of my design process.

### Reflection Summary
This experience was an excellent exercise in merging physical design with digital fabrication. It reinforced the value of collaboration and iterative design, showcasing how modern technology can bring creative ideas to life. Working with Carlotta on this project was not only educational but also inspiring, encouraging us to push the boundaries of what we could achieve within the constraints we faced.

### Final Product and Reflections

The final product exceeded our expectations, both in terms of design and functionality. The chairâ€™s sleek, modern look complemented its comfortable, semi-leaning posture. Although we faced challenges, such as ensuring the structural integrity while maintaining a light and modern appearance, the project was a valuable learning experience. It highlighted the importance of iterative design and the need for careful planning and testing, especially when working with digital fabrication techniques.

In retrospect, this project was an excellent exercise in combining physical design with digital prototyping. It pushed us to think critically about how to translate our ideas into a tangible product using CNC technology. The experience reinforced the value of collaboration and iterative design, and I am proud of the unique piece of furniture we created for our classroom.

Overall, working on this chair with Carlotta was a really cool and educational journey, and it has inspired me to continue exploring the possibilities of digital fabrication in future design projects, and who knows, maybe we can sell this design at some point.

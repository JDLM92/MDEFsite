### Reflecting on My Critical Transfeminist Design Class

My recent experience in the Critical Transfeminist Design class with Laura at Elisava has been profoundly eye-opening and thought-provoking. Titled "El Pressentiment," this class challenged us to explore the philosophical and social constructs surrounding the body, identity, and gender, with a particular focus on their intersection with design. This exploration was incredibly relevant and prescient, especially when considering concepts like queerness and Donna Haraway's "Cyborg Manifesto," which continue to resonate strongly in today's context.

### Exploring the Body and Identity

We began by examining historical perspectives on the body, particularly through the lens of Christian pastoral care and mechanistic views. This dualist ontology, which separates the soul and body, helped us understand the stigmatization of the body and its treatment as a machine. The shift towards phenomenology, especially through Husserl and Merleau-Ponty, introduced the idea of the body as a center of intentionality, where our physical being is intrinsically linked to our interaction with the world. This perspective was both enlightening and transformative, reshaping my understanding of how we perceive our bodies.

### The Impact of Phenomenology and Ontological Monism

The discussion of ontological monism, which views the world as a singular, unified entity, offered a stark contrast to dualism. It challenged us to rethink the nature of reality and the interconnectedness of our experiences. Heidegger's teachings further deepened this understanding by highlighting how our vision and actions are codified by the context in which we exist. This holistic view of existence was a revelation, emphasizing the fluidity and interconnectedness of our lived experiences.

### Integrating Critical Theory and Gender Studies

A significant portion of the class was dedicated to critical theory and gender studies, focusing on the works of Lacan, Foucault, and Butler. Lacan's mirror theory and Foucault's ideas on subjectivity and power structures provided a framework for understanding how identities are formed and controlled. Butlerâ€™s exploration of performativity and the materiality of the body offered a nuanced view of gender as a series of performative acts, shaped by societal norms but also possessing the potential for subversion and redefinition. These theories were not just academic exercises but powerful tools for analyzing and challenging the status quo.

### Transfeminism and New Feminisms

The class also delved into transfeminism, a branch of new feminisms that expands the subjects of feminism to include those oppressed by cisheteropatriarchy, beyond cisgender women. This perspective emphasizes that gender is a social construct used to oppress and exclude, advocating for the recognition of an infinite number of gender identities. It highlights the privileges accorded to cisgender individuals and critiques the binary gender system, advocating for a more inclusive approach that acknowledges the diverse experiences of all gender identities. This inclusive perspective felt revolutionary, pushing us to envision a more equitable world.

### Practical Application and Reflection

The class was not just theoretical but also deeply reflective. We engaged in exercises to understand our own identities and how we communicate them through our work. This included exploring brand stories and values, which was initially challenging but ultimately rewarding as it helped clarify the core takeaways of our projects. This process of reflection and articulation is crucial for effectively communicating our ideas and values to others. The practical application of these concepts reinforced their relevance and impact on our design practices.

### Conclusion

Overall, this class has been very important in shaping my understanding of the interplay between design, identity, and gender. It has reinforced the importance of considering the socio-political context in which design operates and the power dynamics that influence it. By integrating critical theory with practical design principles, the class has provided a holistic approach to creating more inclusive and thoughtful design solutions. As I continue my journey in the Master in Design for Emergent Futures program, these insights will undoubtedly inform and enrich my work, inspiring me to challenge conventional boundaries and contribute to a more inclusive future.

# Extended Intelligences


Reflecting on the Extended Intelligences course, it's like we've been on a wild ride through the AI landscape, and let me tell you, it’s been nothing short of a brain workout. From the get-go with Pau Artigas at the helm, we didn’t just skim the surface of AI; we dove headfirst into its deep and murky waters.

Day 2 was all about getting our heads around the tech side of things. We delved into neural networks, datasets, training, and models. It was like piecing together a complex jigsaw puzzle, with each part – neural networks with their self-configuration mojo, diverse datasets, the nitty-gritty of training, and the final model – coming together to form a complete picture. It’s fascinating how these networks configure themselves based on examples, and how the type of data they work with (be it images, text, or sound) shapes their learning.

Then, Day 3 had us exploring the enigmatic world of Latent Spaces. Imagine a realm where data points are not just data points, but multi-dimensional representations capturing the essence of the data. It’s like stepping into a parallel universe where everything you thought you knew about data gets a whole new meaning.

What really got me thinking was the exercise on datasets. It was an eye-opener, making us critically analyze and choose datasets that resonated with us for various reasons – be it their utility, curiosity, or the potential issues they presented. It pushed us to think beyond the usual and consider the impact of the data we feed into these AI systems.

Throughout the course, we kept circling back to the foundational models, grounding our understanding in the solid bedrock of AI concepts. It’s like having a trusty map while navigating the often-confusing terrain of AI technologies.

In all of this, the ethical and social implications of AI were never far from our minds. It was like having a moral compass guiding us through our journey, ensuring we didn’t lose sight of the bigger picture – the impact of AI on society and our responsibility towards it.

As we wrapped up the course, it was clear that our understanding of AI had evolved. It wasn’t just about the technology anymore; it was about seeing AI as a tool for change, a medium for creative expression, and a subject of critical analysis. It’s like we’ve been equipped with a new lens to view the world, one where AI plays a crucial, yet complex, role.

All in all, the Extended Intelligences course has been an enlightening journey, melding technical skills with critical thinking and a deep understanding of the ethical dimensions of AI. It's not just a course; it’s a whole new perspective on what AI is and what it could be.

# Living With Your Own Ideas

This class has definitely felt different than the other ones.

Using a Meta Quest 2 to prototype Immersive song learning with the current mainstream headset.


### What did you make? And why did it matter?
The most basic version of an immersive song learning / music creation experience.
Since there is not much immersive content yet, it’s a great way to understand where the current technology lies, and where it might still grow in terms of personalized experiences for learning.


### What happens when you involve yourself?
Experience first hand the complexity of making such experiences happen, including hand tracking, and thinking about what the next version of that would be for this specific purpose.
I can easily notice the lack of tracking for the shapes of my fingers is off-putting, but being able to feel like I’m in the room with the other person makes the song learning that much easier.

### What happens when you use yourself as an instrument?
Being an instrument to learn how people play instruments is a funny thought. I’d say that the next generations of musicians will have such an amazing tool at their disposal than what my generation had, and even more compared to past generations. From youtube learning, to immersive learning.

### Did anything change about your way of working?
If I could do the entire songwriting and recording process in an immersive computing experience, I think it could get to a point where what used to be a very expensive way to make things in the past (abbey road records for example), will now be a trivial thing to experience for music production, and any creative task for that matter.

### What does it mean for your future work?
I can see myself being very into creating these sort of specific immersive experiences to elevate what the current process of creating is, to a higher form of situated environment for creativity.


### After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration?
It opens up a whole new world for collaboration if done right. I no longer believe this tech might die in the technology adoption chasm, because the minute people see the possibilities that these tech offers, it will no longer be an unreachable tech, but a countdown to when everyone can access experiences that almost no one had access to before.

# Bio Zero

Reflecting on the Bio Zero course by Nuria Conde, I found the mix of biology and computer science really eye-opening. Seeing life as a complex system of interacting parts changed how I think about nature and tech. Learning about synthetic biology and the CRISPR-Cas9 technology was super interesting, especially thinking about the good it can do and the tough choices involved. Making a GMO for our final project really made me think about how these technologies affect the real world. This course opened my mind a lot and showed me how important it is to combine different areas of study to solve big problems.

Through this exploration we also cultivated samples in agar, and looked at them through a microscope, along with some other interesting stuff Nuria brought.

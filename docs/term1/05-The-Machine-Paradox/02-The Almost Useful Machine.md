## Almost useful machine

For the Almost useful machines workshop, so the second part of last week's episode, the machine paradox, we teamed up with the intention of building something out of the pieces we scavenged.
With my team: Vania, Minnie, Panchi, and Ever. We carried out what the initial ideation resulted in, an almost useful machine for *Anxiety*.

This resulted in us quickly dividing and conquering each necessary activity, with Vania being her best PM self, Minnie being the coding whiz, Panchi being the visionary 3D Modeler, Ever being a Jack of all trades, and Myself helping everyone and making the sound files for our machine, we set up to construct an abomination of a machine with the parts we peeled off other gadgets.

The end product was a very cool looking machine that included a 3/4 dodecahedron controller armed with 10 different buttons with weird and obnoxious labels.
The instructions for the machine are clear: SOLVE ME.
But how would a person solve this anxiety producing nightmare? 
10 Buttons are presented, but what is the answer?

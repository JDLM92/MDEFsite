# The Machine Paradox

The Machine Paradox is going really well, personally I've had a lot of fun disassembling electronics, 
which is something I've done a lot (sometimes with disastrous results), so it's very cool to do this as part of a class. 

I'm really enjoying the forensic report part of the class since it feels like a very investigative kind of activity, with my team and I having to hypothesize how and why things are constructed the way they are, the materials it's made from, the standardized parts that were used for it. Of course we started ideating possible ways to use the components for interesting useless machines.

We disassembled a Bose SoundDock from circa 2006, the ones that were used with iPods, including the 30 pin connector dock.
We also disassembled a Bticino Terraneo video phone, which interestingly enough included a Sony standardized 4" CRT Monitor, same one used for Sony Walkman TVs from the 80's and 90's.

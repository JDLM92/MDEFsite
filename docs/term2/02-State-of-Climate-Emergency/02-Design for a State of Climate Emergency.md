# Designing for a State of Climate Emergency

The "Designing for a State of Climate Emergency" class, led by Andrés Colmenares, was an eye-opener in many ways. Andrés, who heads the Responsible AI master at Elisava, took us through a series of deep, reflective discussions that really made me think about where we stand as a society in the face of climate change.

The class focused on some pretty heavy topics, starting with our situated privilege. It's a concept that made us consider our positions and responsibilities in the world, especially in relation to environmental issues. The discussion about time as a concept was equally thought-provoking, challenging our traditional perceptions and urging us to think beyond the immediate.

Andrés also brought up the idea of growth, including the principles of degrowth as outlined by Giorgios Kallis. The concept of degrowth, suggesting a deliberate downscaling of production and consumption to enhance ecological conditions and equity on the planet, really struck a chord with me. It's a radical shift from our usual growth-driven mindset, but it’s an important one to consider in the context of sustainability and environmental responsibility.

Then there was the talk about "solar-centered design," which was about aligning our design practices more closely with the rhythms and limits of our natural environment. This approach calls for a deeper connection and harmony with nature, rather than exploiting it.

The class was a mix of looking forward and backward. Some of the "back to roots" points resonated with me, emphasizing a return to simpler, more sustainable ways of living. However, I do have my reservations. While I appreciate the value in some of these traditional approaches, I believe our future solutions need to recognize the irreversible changes in our culture and technology. We can't just turn back time; our futures, even if they are less complex, will inherently differ from the past due to these cultural shifts.
Especially since us regular people now have access to a way more complex systemic view of things, than our ancestors did before.

All in all, the week was incredibly thought-provoking. It raised a lot of big questions about the future of our race and our planet. It's clear that we need to rethink many of our current practices and philosophies if we're to address the climate emergency effectively. This class challenged our existing beliefs and made us consider how we can contribute to a more sustainable and responsible future.

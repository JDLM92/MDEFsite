## Microchallenge 2: Crystal Ball

Reflecting on the "Designing with Extended Intelligences" seminar and our subsequent microchallenge, my team— Sophie, Dhrishya, and I —embarked on a venture to harness AI for envisioning urban futures. This project,  christened "Crystal Ball," endeavors to meld current urban policies with potential future scenarios, providing a tangible visualization tool that could significantly impact political understanding and decision-making.

### Ideation and Conceptualization
Our journey began with a shared enthusiasm for speculative future visualization and the untapped potential of generative AI technologies. The concept for "Crystal Ball" was born out of a desire to bridge the gap between abstract policy discussions and tangible, experiential understanding. By leveraging AI to visualize the impacts of policy interventions, we aspired to create a tool that not only informs but engages citizens and policymakers alike, fostering a more inclusive and effective decision-making process.

### Process and Iterations
Our initial experimentation with a custom GPT bot, trained on European policy documents and foresight methodologies, was insightful yet challenging. The disparities in AI-generated image outputs pushed us to explore alternative models, leading us to integrate a more capable image-to-image transformation tool. This pivot exemplified our iterative approach, highlighting the necessity of flexibility and resilience in the face of technological constraints.

### Integrating Policy and Visual Foresight
A pivotal aspect of "Crystal Ball" is its rootedness in current European policy frameworks. By translating the directives of initiatives such as the Renovation Wave and the Circular Economy Action Plan into visual scenarios, we're not just imagining futures; we're grounding our speculations in the policy trajectories shaping our world today. This approach ensures that our visualizations are both imaginative and relevant, offering insights into the practical implications of legislative actions.

### From Visualization to Immersion
Our ambition extends beyond static images. By encoding the visual output of "Crystal Ball" into immersive 360 experiences accessible via smartphone, we're democratizing access to future scenarios. This transition from visualization to immersion is crucial, enabling a broader audience to step into the futures we've crafted and understand the potential outcomes of urban policies in a direct, impactful manner.

### Reflections and Future Directions
"Crystal Ball" stands as a reflection of our collective vision and the potential of AI to enhance civic engagement and policymaking. As we look to the future, our goal is to refine this tool, ensuring its adaptability and effectiveness in engaging a wide range of stakeholders. Our journey with "Crystal Ball" underscores the essence of designing with extended intelligences, where technology amplifies our ability to envision and shape the future.

In conclusion, this microchallenge has been a profound learning experience, affirming the power of collaborative innovation and the role of technology in democratizing policymaking. As we move forward, we carry with us the lessons learned and the ambition to create tools that foster a more inclusive, engaged, and informed society.

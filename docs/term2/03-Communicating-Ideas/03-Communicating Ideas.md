# Communicating Ideas


Returning to the "Communicating Ideas" class, we delved into various narrative structures, including the monomyth, as explained by Pablo. The concept of the monomyth, or the hero's journey, is intriguing due to its broad applicability across cultures and histories. This narrative structure can transform a simple story into a compelling journey, making it a valuable tool for designers seeking to engage their audience meaningfully.

We also dived into the "Golden Circle" activity, inspired by Simon Sinek. This exercise really shifts the focus from what we do to why we do it, which I think is a game-changer. It's easy to get caught up in the specifics of a project - the 'what' and the 'how' - but starting with 'why' digs deeper into the purpose and the driving force behind our work.

I'm particularly eager to apply this exercise in a conversation with Carlotta. Having worked together on previous projects, I have a deep appreciation for her design approach, which cleverly incorporates behavioral nudges for positive change. Understanding her 'why' will offer valuable insights into the underpinnings of her project and how they inform the more visible aspects of her work. This is more than an exercise in understanding her project; itâ€™s about gaining a deeper understanding of Carlotta as a designer and the motivations that drive her creative process. Engaging in such exercises enriches our understanding of our peers' work and strengthens our connections within the design community.

# Design Studio 2


Reflecting on the Design Studio 2 sessions, my conversations with Guillem and Jana have been quite insightful and have significantly shaped my approach to the thesis project. Their positive feedback on the design dialogues approach has been encouraging, but it's the discussion about the thesis project that has really got me thinking.

Jana's suggestion to re-analyze my design space was particularly impactful. It made me realize that while I'm keen on using the methodological framework I initially planned, I need to narrow down and define the subject of my project more clearly. So far, I've been oscillating between three areas: Music Creation, Heat as an Inescapable Experience, and Systemic Transportation Analysis.

The topic of 'Heat' has already been explored in our Fair Futures project, which makes me wonder if revisiting it might be redundant or if there's a new angle I can approach it from. As for Systemic Transportation, I'm already delving into it with my entry for the AI for the Built Environment. This leaves Music Creation, a field that excites me but also leaves me questioning its long-term viability as a project I can continue post-master.

Deciding on the subject is crucial because I want my thesis to be more than just an academic exercise; I envision it as a project that I can develop and grow even after the master's program. Music Creation, while intriguing, needs to be weighed against my long-term goals and interests. Can it evolve into something sustainable and engaging in the long run? Will it allow me to apply and expand the methodological framework I'm interested in?

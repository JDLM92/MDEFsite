# Preferable Futures: Mobility


Kicking off the PreferableFutures: Mobility project has felt like setting out on a vast exploration. It's like I'm at the start of a journey with a map full of uncharted territories. The first steps were about laying down the foundational ideas â€“ the name, mission, vision, purpose, and a snapshot of our collective identity in the "We Are" blurb. This isn't just a project for me; it's a mission to delve into how we can revolutionize mobility for everyone, everywhere.

Naming it PreferableFutures: Mobility was about setting the tone right from the start. This project is my commitment to not just think about the future of getting around but to actively shape it into something better for communities across all sorts of environments. This mission isn't confined to the bustling streets of urban landscapes but extends to any place where people move and live.

From the get-go, my ideas were ambitious, aiming to use AI and immersive technologies as key tools. Reflecting on the microchallenges, it's clear how pivotal these technologies have been. They've not only been tools but also inspirations that have significantly shaped the project's direction since our second design dialogues event. That event, where we shared our "future visions," was a turning point, bringing clarity and excitement to the possibilities ahead.

AI has been like a compass for me, guiding through the complexities of mobility data, uncovering patterns, and insights that human eyes might miss. It's helped me to not just understand the present but to forecast future mobility needs and opportunities. These AI-driven insights have been invaluable, offering a glimpse into the myriad ways we can improve how we move.

Immersive technology, on the other hand, has been like a telescope, allowing me and others to see into the futures we're imagining. Through VR and AR, we've been able to step into these potential futures, experiencing firsthand the impact of our design choices. This hasn't just been about showcasing what could be; it's been an essential tool for engagement, making abstract concepts tangible and accessible.

Reflecting on these experiences since our design dialogues, I realize how these technologies have not just supported but accelerated my journey into PreferableFutures: Mobility. They've enabled a deeper, more collaborative exploration of what's possible, inviting diverse voices to join in the conversation. This approach has fundamentally shaped how I view the project's potential: as a collaborative, technology-driven exploration of what mobility can become.

At this stage, I'm acutely aware of the work that lies ahead. Defining the project, refining our approach, and moving towards execution will require continuous learning, adaptation, and community engagement. But the insights gained from our initial dialogues and the microchallenges have equipped me with a clearer vision and a stronger resolve to push forward.

So here I am, at the beginning of what promises to be an extraordinary journey. I'm armed with the tools of AI and immersive tech, inspired by the possibilities they've already revealed, and motivated by the collaborative spirit they've fostered. As I take the next steps, I'm excited to dive deeper, explore further, and see how far we can go in shaping the futures of mobility that not only move us physically but connect us in ways we've only begun to imagine.

#### City Archetype System

The city archetype system is a core component of IPM, designed to classify cities based on various factors such as topography, climate, city size, and car-centric development levels. This classification allows IPM to tailor solutions that are relevant and effective for each specific urban environment.

**Classification Criteria:**
1. **Topography:** Hilly or Flat
2. **Environmental Geolocation:** Coastal or Inland
3. **Climate:** Hot, Temperate, or Cold
4. **City Size:** Small, Medium, Large, or Mega
5. **Car-Centric Development:** High, Moderate, or Low

**Purpose:**
- Ensure that mobility solutions are context-specific and address the unique challenges of each city.
- Facilitate targeted interventions that are more likely to succeed given the city's specific characteristics.

#### AI and Custom Bot Development

To handle the extensive data required for IPM, a custom bot was developed. This bot is programmed to gather and analyze data from reputable sources, ensuring consistency and reliability in the information used for decision-making.

**Features:**
- **Data Collection:** The bot scrapes data from various reputable sources.
- **Data Analysis:** It processes and analyzes the data to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Consistent Results:** Ensures that the data used is consistent across different analyses.

**Importance:**
- Provides a robust foundation for data-driven decision-making.
- Helps in identifying inflection points by uncovering hidden patterns in mobility data.

#### Multimodal Proportion Analysis

Understanding the proportion of different transportation modes in a city is crucial for developing effective mobility solutions. IPM includes a detailed analysis of these proportions for each city.

**Components:**
- **Public Transport Usage:** Buses, trains, subways, etc.
- **Private Vehicle Usage:** Cars, motorcycles, etc.
- **Non-Motorized Transport:** Walking, cycling, etc.

**Purpose:**
- Provide a comprehensive view of current mobility patterns.
- Identify areas where interventions can shift modal share towards more sustainable options.

#### Immersive Experiences with VR

Virtual reality plays a significant role in IPM by providing immersive experiences that allow stakeholders to visualize potential future mobility scenarios.

**Development:**
- Created using A-frames on Glitch websites.
- Involves coding and testing to ensure realistic and engaging experiences.

**Features:**
- **Scenario Visualization:** Users can explore potential future scenarios in a virtual environment.
- **Impact Assessment:** Helps stakeholders understand the potential impact of proposed changes.

**Importance:**
- Makes abstract concepts tangible and easier to understand.
- Enhances stakeholder engagement and support for proposed solutions.

#### Generating Future Images with SDXL

A key innovative aspect of IPM is generating vivid, descriptive images of future mobility scenarios using Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL). This involves modifying current images of a place through a bespoke prompt system.

**Process:**
- **Image Collection:** Gather current images of the area.
- **Prompt Development:** Create specific prompts based on the desired future scenario.
- **Image Generation:** Use SDXL to generate multiple images, adjusting settings as needed.
- **Selection:** Choose the most accurate representation of the envisioned future.

**Cost and Effort:**
- Involves significant manual effort and adjustment of settings.
- Approximate cost of 6€  for processing on Replicate for this exercise.

**Purpose:**
- Provides a clear, visual representation of proposed changes.
- Helps stakeholders and the community visualize and understand the future mobility landscape.

#### Collaboration and Community Engagement

Collaboration is at the heart of IPM. The project actively engages local governments, experts, residents, and other stakeholders through workshops, interactive sessions, and online forums.

**Activities:**
- **Workshops:** Hands-on sessions to brainstorm and refine mobility solutions.
- **Interactive Sessions:** Engaging activities to gather input and feedback.
- **Online Forums:** Platforms for continuous dialogue and collaboration.
